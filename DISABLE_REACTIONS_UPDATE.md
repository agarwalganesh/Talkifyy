# Disable Emoji Reactions Display

## Overview
This update disables the emoji reactions display in the chat messages, showing only the text content. Users will see clean message bubbles without any emoji reactions underneath.

## Changes Made

### 1. Hidden Reactions Display
- **MessageReactionManager.java**: Modified `updateReactionsDisplay()` method to always hide the reactions container
- Reactions container visibility is set to `View.GONE` regardless of whether reactions exist
- The original reaction display logic is commented out but preserved for future use

### 2. Disabled Double-Tap Functionality
- **ChatRecyclerAdapter.java**: Commented out `setupDoubleClickListener()` call since reactions are disabled
- Double-tap no longer triggers any action
- Long-press still works for context menu (Delete for Me, Delete for Everyone, Select Messages)

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files:

1. **`MessageReactionManager.java`** (Line ~115)
   - Added early return with `reactionsContainer.setVisibility(View.GONE)`
   - Commented out all reaction creation and display logic
   - Reactions data is still stored in the database but not displayed

2. **`ChatRecyclerAdapter.java`** (Line ~240)
   - Commented out `setupDoubleClickListener()` call
   - Updated comment to reflect disabled reactions

## User Experience

### What Users See:
- Clean message bubbles with only text content
- No emoji reactions displayed below messages
- Messages appear cleaner and more focused on text content

### What Still Works:
- Long-press context menu for message actions
- Message selection mode
- All deletion functionality (Delete for Me, Delete for Everyone)
- Message sending and receiving

### What's Disabled:
- Emoji reactions display
- Double-tap gesture (no longer has any function)
- Reaction picker popup
- Reaction toggling

## Data Preservation
- Reaction data is still stored in Firebase database
- No data is lost - reactions are just not displayed
- Easy to re-enable by uncommenting the code

## Benefits
1. **Cleaner Interface**: Messages appear cleaner without emoji clutter
2. **Improved Focus**: Users focus on text content instead of reactions
3. **Better Performance**: Slightly reduced view complexity
4. **Simplified UX**: Fewer gestures and interactions to learn

## Re-enabling Reactions (If Needed)
To re-enable reactions in the future:

1. In `MessageReactionManager.java`:
   - Remove the early return statement (lines ~115-117)
   - Uncomment the reaction display logic (lines ~119-168)

2. In `ChatRecyclerAdapter.java`:
   - Uncomment the `setupDoubleClickListener()` call (line ~240)
   - Update the comment to reflect enabled reactions

## Testing
The code has been successfully compiled and is ready for testing. Key test scenarios:
1. Verify messages display only text content
2. Confirm no emoji reactions appear below messages
3. Test long-press context menu still works
4. Verify message selection mode functions properly

## Compatibility
- Works with both sender and receiver messages
- Compatible with group and direct chats
- Maintains all existing message functionality except reactions
- Does not affect message storage or retrieval
