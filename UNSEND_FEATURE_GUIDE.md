# Unsend Message Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Talkifyy chat application now supports unsending messages with real-time synchronization across all active sessions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **User Interface**
- **Long-press** any message (sent OR received) to show context menu
- **"Delete Message"** option appears in the popup menu
- **Complete removal** - deleted messages disappear entirely from both users' chats
- **No time restrictions** - can delete messages anytime
- **Universal access** - any user can delete any message in the chat

### 2. **Backend Implementation**
- **Real-time synchronization** using Firestore listeners
- **Universal deletion** - any participant can delete any message
- **Complete deletion** - messages are permanently removed from database
- **Database consistency** - atomic operations prevent partial states
- **Chatroom last message updates** when latest message is deleted

### 3. **Security & Validation**
- **No sender restrictions** - any chat participant can delete any message
- **No time restrictions** - messages can be deleted anytime
- **Error handling** - comprehensive error messages and fallback behavior
- **Offline support** - changes sync when users come back online

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components Added/Modified:

1. **ChatMessageModel** - Added unsend status fields
2. **FirebaseUtil** - Added unsend operations and validations
3. **ChatRecyclerAdapter** - Added long-press handling and UI updates
4. **ChatActivity** - Implemented unsend workflow and callbacks
5. **UnsendConfig** - Configurable time window settings

### Database Schema Changes:
```
/chatrooms/{chatroomId}/chats/{messageId}:
  - isUnsent: boolean
  - unsentTimestamp: Timestamp
  - message: "This message was unsent" (when unsent)
```

## Configuration Options

### Time Window Settings:
- **Default:** 10 minutes
- **No limit:** Set to 0 minutes  
- **Custom:** Any positive number of minutes
- **Location:** `UnsendConfig.setUnsendTimeWindowMinutes(context, minutes)`

### UI Customization:
- **Unsent message text:** "This message was unsent"
- **Colors:** Gray text for unsent messages
- **Styling:** Italic formatting for unsent messages

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Basic Delete Workflow**
1. Send a message in any chat
2. Long-press ANY message (sent or received)
3. Select "Delete Message" from popup
4. Verify message disappears completely from both users' chats
5. Verify change appears on both devices immediately

### 2. **Universal Deletion Access**
1. User A sends a message to User B
2. User B can long-press and delete User A's message
3. User A can long-press and delete User B's message
4. Verify message disappears from both sides in all cases

### 3. **No Time Restrictions**
1. Send a message
2. Wait any amount of time (hours, days)
3. Long-press the message
4. Verify "Delete Message" option is always available and enabled

### 4. **Real-time Synchronization**
1. Have two devices/sessions open with the same chat
2. Delete any message from one device
3. Verify it disappears immediately on the other device
4. Test with one device offline - verify sync when back online

### 5. **Edge Cases**
- Delete the last message in a chat (verify chat list updates)
- Network interruption during deletion (verify eventual consistency)
- Rapid deletion attempts (verify proper handling)
- Delete messages from different users in sequence

## Error Handling

### User-facing Messages:
- **Success:** "Message unsent"
- **Time expired:** "Cannot unsend this message. Time limit expired"
- **Permission denied:** "You can only unsend your own messages"
- **Network error:** "Failed to unsend message: [error details]"

### Backend Validation:
- Sender verification before any database updates
- Time window validation with server timestamps
- Atomic operations to prevent partial states
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Real-time Features

### Firestore Listeners:
- **Automatic UI updates** when messages are unsent
- **No manual refresh required** - changes appear instantly
- **Works offline** - changes sync when connection restored
- **Consistent across devices** - all sessions stay synchronized

### Performance Considerations:
- **Efficient queries** using Firestore real-time listeners
- **Minimal data transfer** - only changed fields updated
- **Client-side caching** via FirebaseUI RecyclerAdapter
- **Lazy loading** for chat history

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Batch unsend** - unsend multiple messages at once
2. **Unsend notifications** - notify when someone unsends
3. **Admin controls** - disable unsend for certain users/groups  
4. **Message recovery** - admin ability to view unsent messages
5. **Custom time windows** - per-chat or per-user time limits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Menu not appearing:** Check long-press listener implementation
2. **Time validation failing:** Verify server/client time sync
3. **Real-time not working:** Check Firestore security rules
4. **Permission errors:** Verify current user authentication

### Debug Logs:
All operations are logged with tag "ChatActivity", "FirebaseUtil", or "ChatRecyclerAdapter" for easy debugging.
