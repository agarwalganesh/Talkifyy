# WhatsApp-Style "Delete for Me" Feature

## Overview

Your Talkify app now implements a complete WhatsApp-style "Delete for Me" feature that allows users to hide conversations locally without permanently deleting them from the database. When a new message arrives in a deleted chat, the conversation automatically reappears in the chat list.

## How It Works

### 1. **Local Storage Only**
- When a user selects "Delete for Me", the conversation is only hidden from their local device
- The conversation history remains intact in the Firebase database
- Other participants in the chat are unaffected
- Contact mapping is preserved in local storage

### 2. **Automatic Restoration**
- If a contact sends a new message to a locally deleted chat, the conversation automatically reappears
- The chat shows up at the top of the list with the new message
- All previous conversation history is preserved and accessible
- Works exactly like WhatsApp's behavior

### 3. **Real-Time Monitoring**
- A background service (`ChatRestorationService`) monitors all locally deleted chats
- When new messages are detected, chats are instantly restored
- No manual refresh required - restoration happens automatically

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **LocalDeletionUtil.java**
```java
// Mark a chat as locally deleted
LocalDeletionUtil.markChatAsLocallyDeleted(context, chatroomId);

// Check if a chat is locally deleted
boolean isDeleted = LocalDeletionUtil.isChatLocallyDeleted(context, chatroomId);

// Restore a locally deleted chat
LocalDeletionUtil.restoreLocallyDeletedChat(context, chatroomId);

// Get deletion timestamp
long timestamp = LocalDeletionUtil.getChatDeletionTimestamp(context, chatroomId);
```

#### 2. **ChatRestorationService.java**
- Monitors locally deleted chats for new messages
- Automatically triggers restoration when new messages arrive
- Handles real-time Firebase listeners for deleted chats
- Notifies the UI to refresh when chats are restored

#### 3. **RecentChatRecyclerAdapter.java**
- Filters out locally deleted chats from the UI
- Checks for restoration conditions during binding
- Handles the "Delete for Me" context menu option
- Manages chat visibility and animations

#### 4. **ChatFragment.java**
- Integrates with ChatRestorationService
- Handles UI refresh when chats are restored
- Manages lifecycle of restoration monitoring

## Storage Mechanism

### SharedPreferences Storage
```
local_deletions:
  ├── deleted_chats: Set<String>           // Set of locally deleted chat IDs
  ├── chat_deletion_timestamps_<chatId>   // Deletion timestamp per chat
  └── deleted_messages_<chatId>           // Locally deleted messages per chat
```

### Data Persistence
- **Deletion State**: Stored locally using SharedPreferences
- **Chat History**: Remains in Firebase Firestore (unchanged)
- **Contact Mapping**: Preserved in local storage
- **Timestamps**: Used to determine when to restore chats

## User Flow

### Deleting a Chat
1. Long press on a chat in the recent chats list
2. Select "Delete Chat" from context menu
3. Choose "Delete for Me" option
4. Chat disappears from the UI immediately
5. Chat ID and deletion timestamp are stored locally

### Chat Restoration
1. Contact sends a new message to the deleted chat
2. ChatRestorationService detects the new message
3. Service checks if message timestamp > deletion timestamp
4. If newer, chat is automatically restored
5. UI refreshes to show the restored chat at the top
6. All previous messages are still accessible

## Key Features

### ✅ Implemented Features
- **Local Deletion**: Hides chats only on current device
- **Automatic Restoration**: Chats reappear when new messages arrive
- **Contact Mapping**: Contact information is preserved
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Background service monitors deleted chats
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Precise restoration logic based on timestamps
- **UI Consistency**: Smooth animations and immediate feedback
- **WhatsApp-like UX**: Identical behavior to WhatsApp's "Delete for Me"

### ✅ Edge Cases Handled
- **User sends message after deletion**: Won't auto-restore (prevents confusion)
- **Other user sends message**: Immediately restores the chat
- **Multiple deleted chats**: All are monitored simultaneously
- **App restart**: Restoration monitoring resumes automatically
- **Network issues**: Restoration works when connectivity returns

## Differences from "Delete for Everyone"

| Feature | Delete for Me | Delete for Everyone |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Scope** | Local device only | All participants |
| **Database** | Unchanged | Messages deleted |
| **Restoration** | Automatic with new messages | Not possible |
| **Other Users** | Unaffected | Messages removed |
| **Undo** | Automatic restoration | Not possible |

## Code Example

### Using the Delete for Me Feature
```java
// In your chat adapter or fragment
public void deleteChatForMe(String chatroomId, String displayName) {
    // Mark as locally deleted
    LocalDeletionUtil.markChatAsLocallyDeleted(context, chatroomId);
    
    // Add to restoration monitoring
    if (restorationService != null) {
        restorationService.addChatToMonitoring(chatroomId);
    }
    
    // Show confirmation
    Toast.makeText(context, "Chat with " + displayName + " deleted for you", 
                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    
    // Refresh UI
    adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
}

// Restoration happens automatically via ChatRestorationService
@Override
public void onChatRestored(String chatroomId, ChatroomModel chatroom) {
    Log.d(TAG, "Chat restored: " + chatroomId);
    
    // Refresh adapter to show restored chat
    if (adapter != null) {
        adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Efficiency
- **Minimal Database Impact**: No changes to Firebase database
- **Local Storage**: Fast SharedPreferences operations
- **Smart Monitoring**: Only monitors deleted chats (not all chats)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Stops monitoring when chats are restored

### Memory Management
- **Lifecycle Aware**: Service tied to fragment/activity lifecycle
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of Firebase listeners
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient handling of multiple deletions

## Testing the Feature

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Delete Chat**: Long press → Delete → Delete for Me
2. **Verify Hiding**: Chat should disappear immediately
3. **Send Message**: Have the other user send a message
4. **Verify Restoration**: Chat should reappear at top with new message
5. **Check History**: All previous messages should be accessible

### Edge Case Testing
- Delete multiple chats and verify all are monitored
- Restart app and verify monitoring resumes
- Send message from both sides after deletion
- Test with poor network connectivity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Chat not restoring**: Check Firebase connectivity
2. **Multiple restorations**: Verify cleanup logic
3. **Memory leaks**: Ensure proper listener cleanup
4. **UI not updating**: Check adapter refresh calls

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logs to monitor the restoration process:
```java
// In LocalDeletionUtil
Log.d("LocalDeletionUtil", "Chat marked as deleted: " + chatroomId);
Log.d("LocalDeletionUtil", "Chat restored: " + chatroomId);

// In ChatRestorationService
Log.d("ChatRestorationService", "New message detected: " + chatroomId);
Log.d("ChatRestorationService", "Restoring chat: " + chatroomId);
```

## Conclusion

Your "Delete for Me" implementation provides a complete WhatsApp-like experience where:
- Conversations are hidden locally but preserved in the database
- Contact mappings are maintained for future restoration
- New messages automatically trigger chat restoration
- The user experience is smooth and intuitive

This ensures that no conversation history is permanently lost while giving users the ability to clean up their chat list as needed.
